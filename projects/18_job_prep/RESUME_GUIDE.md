## How to Talk About Projects Without Revealing Code

### ❌ Don't Say:
"I built a personal project for learning"

### ✅ Do Say:
"I designed and implemented a data platform for customer analytics"

### Key Phrases:
- "Architected a solution for..."
- "Implemented ETL pipelines to..."
- "Optimized data processing by..."
- "Reduced query time from X to Y"
- "Processed N records per day"
- "Achieved X% improvement in..."

## Quantifying Your Work

### Add Numbers:
- "Processed 1M+ records daily"
- "Reduced pipeline runtime by 40%"
- "Improved query performance by 60%"
- "Achieved 85% model accuracy"
- "Served 10K+ API requests/day"

## Sample Bullet Points

### ETL/Data Pipeline:
- Developed automated ETL pipeline using Airflow to extract data from multiple 
  sources, transform using Pandas, and load into PostgreSQL warehouse
  
- Implemented data quality checks reducing data errors by 75% and ensuring 
  99.9% data accuracy

### Data Warehousing:
- Designed star schema data warehouse supporting 50+ analytical queries with 
  sub-second response times
  
- Optimized database indexes and partitioning strategies, improving query 
  performance by 60%

### API Development:
- Built RESTful API using FastAPI to serve ML predictions with 99.5% uptime 
  and <500ms latency
  
- Implemented batch prediction endpoints processing 10K+ requests daily

### ML/AI:
- Deployed churn prediction model achieving 85% accuracy, identifying at-risk 
  customers 2 weeks in advance
  
- Integrated LangChain for document Q&A, reducing support ticket resolution 
  time by 30%

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Listing technologies without context
   ✅ Show how you used them and the impact

2. ❌ Using vague terms like "helped with"
   ✅ Use action verbs: "Designed", "Implemented", "Optimized"

3. ❌ No metrics or results
   ✅ Always quantify impact

4. ❌ Mentioning it's a "learning project"
   ✅ Frame it as solving a real problem

5. ❌ Too technical for recruiters
   ✅ Balance technical depth with business value

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Tips

1. Use standard section headers
2. Include keywords from job description
3. Use simple formatting (no tables, columns)
4. Save as PDF
5. Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri)

## Tailoring for Service Companies

### Emphasize:
- Client-facing experience (if any)
- Adaptability to different tech stacks
