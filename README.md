## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this bootcamp, you'll have:
- ✅ **5 Production-Ready Projects** deployable via Docker
- ✅ **ETL Pipelines** orchestrated with Apache Airflow
- ✅ **Data Warehouse** with optimized star schema
- ✅ **ML Model Serving** via FastAPI
- ✅ **End-to-End Platform** integrating all components
- ✅ **Portfolio** ready for Data Engineer interviews

## 🚀 Roles & Skills You Will Master
This bootcamp is strictly mapped to demanding, real-world tech stacks. Rather than just learning the syntax of Python, you will build systems that prepare you for:

### **1. Enterprise Data Engineering & ETL**
- **Core Skills:** Designing fault-tolerant ETL/ELT pipelines, Data Modeling, and Star Schemas.
- **The Tech Stack:** **Apache Airflow** for DAG orchestration, and **PostgreSQL** Data Warehouses (teaching the core analytical concepts you will need for cloud engines like **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, or **AWS Redshift**).

### **2. Generative AI & ML Engineering**
- **Core Skills:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Mathematical Embeddings, and Similarity Search.
- **The Tech Stack:** **LangChain**, Local CPU Models, **FastAPI** model serving, and **Vector Databases** (mastering the math behind Vector Search locally via **pgvector** before you pay for cloud equivalents like **Pinecone** or **Weaviate**).

### **3. Streaming & Cloud-Native Platforms**
- **Core Skills:** Real-time event ingestion, NoSQL modeling, and Cloud Architectures.
- **The Tech Stack:** **Kafka** (running the low-RAM C++ alternative **Redpanda**), and **AWS Services** (mocking **S3**, **DynamoDB**, and **IAM** entirely locally via **LocalStack**).
