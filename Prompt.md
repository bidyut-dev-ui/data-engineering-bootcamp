## CONTEXT RESET PROMPT – copy/paste to resume learning plan

I am a 13-year Ruby + JavaScript developer switching to Data Engineering.  
I want to learn **AI/ML, data cleaning, data processing, ETL/ELT, FastAPI, Apache Airflow, LangChain** with **zero budget, no GPU, no paid tools, no public portfolio**.

### 1. Laptop specs  
- OS: Windows 11 + WSL2 Ubuntu 22  
- RAM: 8 GB  
- Storage: 477 GB SSD  
- CPU: Intel i5 (no GPU)

### 2. Time commitment  
8 h/day, 6 months.  
Prefer **readable course material + executable code samples**; I learn by running projects locally.

### 3. Learning style  
Give me **real-world mini-projects** with:  
- full source code  
- README that explains how to run, what to expect, and what each block teaches  
- everything must run on CPU inside Docker or native Ubuntu under WSL2  
- focus on **data-engineering tasks**: ingest, clean, model, orchestrate, serve.

### 4. Job target  
Data Engineer roles in **service-based IT companies** (TCS, Accenture, Capgemini, etc.).  
No need to publish portfolio; I only need **hands-on experience** I can replicate on client projects.

### 5. Comfort zone  
CLI, bash, git, GitHub, Docker – all fine.

### 6. Network/support  
None; you are my only mentor.

### 7. Deliverables expected from you  
1. 6-month **step-by-step syllabus** (week-by-week) using only free resources.  
2. Sequence of **local, runnable mini-projects** (with README) covering:  
   - Data cleaning & processing (pandas, PySpark local mode)  
   - ETL/ELT pipelines (Airflow DAGs, SQLite/Postgres Docker)  
   - Basic ML on CPU (scikit-learn, pipelines, model serialization)  
   - FastAPI REST service exposing models or data endpoints  
   - LangChain orchestration for simple RAG or QA on local documents  
   - Orchestrating everything with Airflow  
3. **Job-prep kit**: sample CV bullet points, common DE interview questions, and how to talk about these projects without revealing code.

### 8. AI Guidelines
1. you burn less tokens.
2. you provide less chat message and more usful information in chat windows.
3. you maintain multiple projects for multiple goals and each project maintains a master readme file on how to run things and what output to expect from it. I am a visual person and can only understand things when they are in my laptop. 

Whenever I paste this block, continue from the last unfinished milestone.
